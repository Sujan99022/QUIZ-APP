// Important Note: There is a bug in the project, which I am currently working on. The bug occurs when you select option A in question number 1. In question number 2, if you attempt to select the same option A, it won't register. Instead, you'll need to select a different option first, and then you can select option A. This issue is not limited to option A, It applies to other options as well. Therefore, always select a different option initially, and then select the actual answer ``if and only if you are trying to select the same option as previous questions selected option``. //
